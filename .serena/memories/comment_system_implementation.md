# Comment System Implementation

## Overview
The Diverge application has a fully functional comment system that allows users to add comments to chat nodes. The system is designed with multi-user collaboration in mind for future expansion.

## Current Implementation Status

### Database Structure
- **node_comments table**: Stores comments with basic fields (id, node_id, session_id, user_id, content, timestamps)
- **session_participants table**: Prepared for multi-user collaboration (owner, editor, viewer roles)
- **user_profiles table**: Stores display names and avatars for users
- **comment_reactions table**: Prepared for emoji reactions feature

### Frontend Components
- **NodeDetailSidebar** (`src/components/chat/node-detail-sidebar.tsx`):
  - Comment display with user icon and timestamps
  - Comment input field with save functionality
  - Delete comment functionality
  - Simplified Details section showing Status, Created, and abbreviated Node ID (last 8 chars)

### API Implementation
- **GET /api/comments**: Fetches comments for a node or session
- **POST /api/comments**: Creates new comments
- **PUT /api/comments**: Updates existing comments
- **DELETE /api/comments**: Deletes comments

### Hooks
- **useComments** (`src/hooks/useComments.ts`): React hook for managing comment state and operations

## Recent UI Updates
1. Reduced spacing between comment input and comment list (mt-3 instead of default)
2. Simplified Details section to show only Status, Created, and Node ID
3. Node ID displayed as abbreviated format (last 8 characters) without copy functionality
4. Details section uses glassmorphism design with Settings icon header
