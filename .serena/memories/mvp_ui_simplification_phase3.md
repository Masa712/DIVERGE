# MVP UI Simplification - Phase 3: Unified Input (Completed)

## Date: 2025-08-22

## Overview
Successfully completed the third phase of MVP UI simplification by unifying all input to a single text form at the bottom of the screen.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Branch Functionality from Nodes
- **src/components/tree/message-node.tsx**:
  - Removed all branch-related state variables (showBranchInput, branchPrompt, isCreatingBranch)
  - Removed handleBranchSubmit and related keyboard handlers
  - Deleted branch input textarea from the UI
  - Deleted "Branch from here" button
  - Simplified the component to focus only on message display and node ID interaction

### 2. Cleaned Up Parent Components
- **src/app/chat/[id]/page.tsx**:
  - Removed handleBranchCreate function (lines 86-109 deleted)
  - Cleaned up ChatTreeView props

- **src/app/chat/page.tsx**:
  - Removed handleBranchCreate function (lines 151-174 deleted)
  - Cleaned up ChatTreeView props

- **src/app/test-balanced-tree/page.tsx**:
  - Removed handleBranchCreate function (lines 16-39 deleted)

### 3. Updated Component Props
- **src/components/tree/chat-tree-view.tsx**:
  - Removed onBranchCreate prop
  - Simplified prop passing to CompactTreeView

- **src/components/tree/BalancedTreeView.tsx**:
  - Removed onBranchCreate from Props interface
  - Removed onBranchCreate from node data passed to MessageNode

## Result
- All user input is now centralized to the single text form at the bottom of the screen
- Nodes no longer have individual input fields or branch buttons
- The UI is cleaner and more focused on the conversation flow
- Node ID click-to-insert functionality remains intact
- Successfully passed TypeScript type checking

## Previous Phases Completed
1. **Phase 1**: Removed debug panel and minimap from tree view
2. **Phase 2**: Implemented node ID auto-insertion with focus management

## Status
The application is now in MVP-ready state with all requested UI simplifications implemented.
