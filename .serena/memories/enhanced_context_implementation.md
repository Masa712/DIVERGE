# Enhanced Context Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented enhanced context building system to solve the core limitation of linear context building in tree-based conversations.

## Problem Solved
- **Previous Issue**: Tree structure was pseudo-tree-like, couldn't properly reference past topics due to linear context building
- **Solution**: Multi-dimensional context system with sibling awareness and explicit node references

## Implementation Details

### Core Files Created/Modified

#### 1. Enhanced Context System (`src/lib/db/enhanced-context.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Server-side context building with sibling node awareness
- **Key Features**:
  - Recursive ancestor chain building
  - Sibling node detection and summarization
  - Explicit node reference resolution
  - Token counting and optimization
  - Fallback to basic context on errors

#### 2. Node Reference Utilities (`src/lib/utils/node-references.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Client-side safe utilities for node reference handling
- **Functions**:
  - `extractNodeReferences()`: Supports @node_xxx, #xxx, [[node:xxx]] formats
  - `getShortNodeId()`: Display-friendly node IDs
  - `formatNodeReference()`: User-friendly reference formatting

#### 3. API Integration (`src/app/api/chat/route.ts`)
- **Enhanced Features**:
  - Node reference extraction from user prompts
  - Enhanced context building with sibling awareness
  - Metadata tracking for context usage
  - Graceful fallback to basic context

#### 4. UI Enhancements (`src/components/chat/chat-input.tsx`)
- **Real-time Features**:
  - Live node reference detection
  - Reference validation against available nodes
  - Helper UI showing detected references
  - Enhanced placeholder with usage instructions

#### 5. Node Display (`src/components/tree/message-node.tsx`)
- **User Experience**:
  - Clickable node ID display for easy reference copying
  - Short ID format (#abc12345) with hover effects
  - Copy-to-clipboard functionality

## Technical Architecture

### Context Building Flow
1. Extract node references from user prompt
2. Build ancestor chain using recursive CTE
3. Detect and summarize sibling branches
4. Include explicitly referenced nodes
5. Optimize for token limits
6. Provide metadata for debugging

### Reference Formats Supported
- `@node_12345678` or `@12345678` (short form)
- `#12345678` (hash reference)
- `[[node:12345678]]` (wiki-style)

### Error Handling
- Client/server context separation prevents build errors
- Graceful fallback to basic context on enhanced context failures
- TypeScript compatibility fixes for regex operations

## Recent Fixes
1. **Build Error Resolution**: Separated client/server Supabase usage
2. **File Architecture**: Split utilities for client/server compatibility
3. **TypeScript Compatibility**: Fixed regex iteration and Set usage issues

## Performance Considerations
- Token-aware context building (default 4000 token limit)
- Efficient sibling summarization
- Database query optimization with indexes
- Graceful degradation on context failures

## User Benefits
- Can reference any past conversation topic explicitly
- AI understands parallel conversation branches
- Context-aware responses across tree dimensions
- Easy-to-use reference syntax with UI helpers

## Status: âœ… Complete and Tested
- Build errors resolved
- Enhanced context system operational
- UI helpers working
- Node reference system functional
