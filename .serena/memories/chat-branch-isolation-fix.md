# Chat Branch Isolation Fix - Context Contamination Resolution

## Problem
- Chat conversations in different branches (A and B) were contaminating each other
- Branch A conversation content was being included in Branch B's context and vice versa
- Users reported that conversations in one branch would reference and build upon content from completely separate branches
- This broke the fundamental expectation of independent conversation branches

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was in the Enhanced Context system that builds conversation history for AI models:

1. **Session-wide Node Fetching**: `getCachedSessionNodes()` fetched ALL nodes from the entire session, treating them as "sibling nodes"
2. **Default Sibling Inclusion**: `includeSiblings: true` was the default in context building functions
3. **Cross-branch Contamination**: Nodes from Branch A were considered "siblings" to nodes in Branch B, causing context mixing

### Affected Functions:
- `buildFlexibleEnhancedContext()` in `/src/lib/db/flexible-context.ts`
- `buildEnhancedContext()` in `/src/lib/db/enhanced-context.ts`
- Chat API endpoints using these functions with `includeSiblings: true`

## Solution Implementation

### 1. Fixed Flexible Context Builder
**File**: `/src/lib/db/flexible-context.ts`
- **Removed sibling fetching**: Eliminated `getCachedSessionNodes()` call completely
- **Ancestor-only approach**: Use only direct ancestors from `get_node_ancestors()` RPC function
- **Enhanced logging**: Added cross-branch isolation confirmation logs

### 2. Fixed Enhanced Context Builder
**File**: `/src/lib/db/enhanced-context.ts`
- **Changed default**: `includeSiblings = false` (was `true`)
- **Added isolation warnings**: Warning logs when siblings are explicitly enabled
- **Improved documentation**: Clear comments about cross-branch contamination risks

### 3. Fixed Chat API Endpoints
**Files**: 
- `/src/app/api/chat/route.ts`
- `/src/app/api/chat/branch/route.ts`

**Changes**:
- Explicitly set `includeSiblings: false` in `buildContextWithStrategy()` calls
- Added comments explaining the fix

## Technical Details

### Before Fix:
```typescript
// Session nodes included ALL nodes from session (branches A, B, C, etc.)
const sessionNodes = await getCachedSessionNodes(sessionId)
const siblings = sessionNodes.filter(node => ...)

// Default behavior included siblings
const enhancedContext = await buildContextWithStrategy(parentNodeId, userPrompt, {
  includeSiblings: true, // ❌ This caused cross-contamination
  // ...
})
```

### After Fix:
```typescript
// Only direct ancestors are used (proper conversation thread)
const ancestors: ChatNode[] = (ancestorData || [])
  .map((node: any) => convertDbNodeToChatNode(node, model))
  .sort((a: ChatNode, b: ChatNode) => a.depth - b.depth)

// No siblings from other branches
const enhancedContext = await buildContextWithStrategy(parentNodeId, userPrompt, {
  includeSiblings: false, // ✅ Prevents cross-branch contamination
  // ...
})
```

## Key SQL Function Behavior
The `get_node_ancestors(node_id UUID)` SQL function correctly returns only the direct lineage:
- Given node → Parent → Grandparent → Root
- Does NOT include siblings or other branches
- This was working correctly; the issue was in the application layer

## Validation & Testing
✅ **Branch Independence**: Conversation in Branch A does not appear in Branch B context
✅ **Ancestor Chain Integrity**: Direct conversation history is preserved within each branch  
✅ **Reference System**: Explicit node references (like `@abc12345`) still work for cross-branch references
✅ **Performance**: Reduced context building overhead by eliminating unnecessary sibling queries

## Console Log Indicators
Users can verify the fix is working by looking for these logs:
- `🚫 Cross-branch isolation: siblings from other branches excluded`
- `🔒 Branch isolation: ACTIVE` 
- `🔗 Using ONLY direct ancestors: X nodes (no cross-branch contamination)`

## Impact
- **User Experience**: Chat branches now work as expected - completely independent conversations
- **Context Quality**: AI responses are more focused and relevant to the specific conversation thread
- **Performance**: Slight improvement from reduced context complexity
- **Reliability**: Eliminates confusion from mixed conversation contexts
