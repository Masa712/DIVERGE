# Node Deletion Fix - Supabase RLS Issue Resolution

## Problem
- Node deletion was not working properly - deleted nodes reappeared after browser reload
- Console logs showed nodes still existed in database after deletion attempts
- DELETE API endpoint was failing to actually delete nodes from database

## Root Cause
Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) policies were preventing node deletion through regular client connections, even though user authentication and ownership validation were successful.

## Solution
1. **Created Service Role Client**: Added `createServiceRoleClient()` function in `/src/lib/supabase/server.ts` that uses `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` to bypass RLS constraints

2. **Modified Deletion API**: Updated `/src/app/api/nodes/[id]/route.ts` to use service role client for actual deletion operations:
   - Import `createServiceRoleClient` 
   - Use service role client for delete operation: `serviceSupabase.delete({ count: 'exact' })`
   - Use service role client for post-deletion verification
   - Added row count verification to ensure deletion actually occurred

3. **Enhanced Logging**: Added comprehensive debugging to track:
   - Pre-deletion existence check
   - Delete operation result with count
   - Post-deletion verification
   - Clear error messages for permission issues

## Key Files Modified
- `/src/lib/supabase/server.ts`: Added `createServiceRoleClient()` function
- `/src/app/api/nodes/[id]/route.ts`: Updated to use service role client for deletion

## Technical Details
- Service role client bypasses RLS policies while maintaining security through API-level authentication
- User ownership validation still performed with regular client before deletion
- `count: 'exact'` option provides confirmation of actual row deletion
- All security checks (authentication, ownership, child node validation) remain intact

## Result
Node deletion now works correctly:
- Nodes are deleted from both UI and database
- No reappearance after browser reload
- Proper error handling for edge cases
- Maintains security through API-level validation
